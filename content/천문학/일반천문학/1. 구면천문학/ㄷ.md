Question 3-Proper motion
Max 30 points
Difference in radial distance is about $1,58 \cdot 10^{15} \mathrm{~m}$
Difference in right ascension is about $2.4767^{\circ}$
Difference in declination is about $1.84^{\circ}$
2
Thus the angular distance on the sky is about $3.09^{\circ}$
3
Calculating the linear distance perpendicular to the line of sight
Using trigonometric functions and the distance from the Sun, we obtain a distance of $2,1 \cdot 10^{15} \mathrm{~m}$
2
The distance between the stars is thus $2,63 \cdot 10^{15} \mathrm{~m}$
3
Calculate the difference in angulare velocity in R.A. and Dec. Calculations (same method) for R.A. and Dec give a difference of $0.18 \mathrm{arcsec} /$ year in both.
$2+2$
Conversion of angular velocity on the sky to transverse linear velocity. (works out aroud $1.5 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{s}$ )
4
Note that transverse velocity is a lower limit to total velocity
2.
Compare obtained velocity to velocity expected for the distances between stars.
At distances of tens of thousands of $\mathrm{AU}$ the velocity is too great for the stars to form a bound system even with very massive stars. Even for a pair of one light and one heavy star, the heavy one would have a mass of thousands of Solar masses.
