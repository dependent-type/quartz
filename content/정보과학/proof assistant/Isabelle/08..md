```
fun reverse :: "'a list ⇒ 'a list" where
"reverse [] = []" |
"reverse (x # xs) = reverse xs @ [x]"
```

The time complexity of this code is $n^{2}$.

Here is more efficient way:

```
fun itrev :: "'a list ⇒ 'a list ⇒ 'a list" where
"itrev [] ys = ys" |
"itrev (x # xs) ys = itrev xs (x # ys)"
```

It requires linear time complexity.

we want to show
```
lemma rev_rev: "reverse (reverse xs) = xs"
  oops
```

Therefore we first prove the lemma that

``` 
lemma rev_itrev: "reverse xs = itrev xs []"
```
