Dependent type theory is a system of inference rules that can be combined to make derivations. In these derivations, the goal is often to construct an element of a certain type. Such an element can be a function if the type of the constructed element is a function type; a proof of a property if the type of the constructed element is a proposition; but it can also be an identification if the type of the constructed element is an identity type, and so on. In some respect, a type is just a collection of mathematical objects and constructing elements of a type is the everyday mathematical task or challenge. The system of inference rules that we call type theory offers a principled way of engaging in mathematical activity.
