#### Ordered Sets
Definition. Let S be a set. a binary truth relation on S s.t.
 i. For each pair $x,y\in S \times S$, only one of $x<y, x=y, x>y$ is true.
 ii. For $x,y,z\in S$, if $x< y$ and $y< z$ then $x< z$.
 In that case, we call $<$ an order on $S$ and call $S$,$<$ an **ordered set**.

#### Boundedness
Definition. Say $E\subset S$ an ordered set. 
If $\exists \beta \subset S$ s.t. ∀x∈E, B>=x, then we call β an upper bound of E.
and say E is bounded above. (Similarly for lower boundes, bounded below)
