# $\S 12 \text{ Topological Spaces}$

$\textbf{Remind.}$
At analysis, we just studied about **realline** $\mathbb{R}$ and their expansion such as $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which we call **euclidean space**, and studied **continuous function** on these spaces.
Moreover, we just introduced the concepts of **open sets** and **limit points** to build a structure of **continuous functions**. This was possible because $\mathbb{R}$ is a very good set that satisfies several useful properties. Therefore, at topology, we expand the concept of $\mathbb{R}$, as broad as possible to include various models that were useful in mathematics.
