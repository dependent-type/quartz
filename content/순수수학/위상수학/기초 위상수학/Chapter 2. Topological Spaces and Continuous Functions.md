The concept of topological space grew out of the study of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ and euclidean space and the study of continuous functions on these spaces.

Open sets, limit points and continuous functions are introduced as natural generalizations of the corresponding ideas for $\mathbb{R}$ in Analysis.

The definition of topological space was formulated:

- as broad as possible to include various models that were useful in mathematics, and  
- narrow enough so that the standard theorems would hold for topological space in general.

Key point is the definition of ‘continuity’:  
- In Analysis ($\mathbb{R}$), we use ‘limit’ ( or $\epsilon$ − $\delta$ definition) $\longleftarrow$ ‘metric’ is needed. 
- In Topology, we use ‘open’ $\longleftarrow$ ‘metric’ is not needed.

Properties of open sets in $\mathbb{R}$ (in Analysis): 

(1) $\phi$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are open.
(2) $U_\alpha$ is open for all $\alpha \in J$ $\Rightarrow$ arbitrary union $U_{\alpha} \in J$ Uα is open.  
(3) Ui is open for all i = 1,2,...,n ⇒ finite intersection 􏱪ni=1 Ui is open.
